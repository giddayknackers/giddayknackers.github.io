  <h2>Personal Info</h2>
  <p>Ernie Crust is an Australian between the ages of 18 and 88. 
      A dimly interesting fact about Ernie is, as of writing, he is <i>three</i>(that's right, three) months into the only 
      New Year's resolution he's ever made that's stuck. The sticky resolution being the not so SMART goal of "read heaps this year"
      (14 books and counting, more than I've ever read in an entire year prior). Good on Ernie.

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person
            that sparked your interest? What IT experience have you got to show for yourself?</i>
            <p>I've had an oblique interest in IT since the N64 for Christmas turned me into a dweeb. I've always liked
            sci-fi and to a similar extent philosophy. I got interested in IT specifically as machine learning started
            getting really big (around the time of the MNIST watershed moment). My specific interest in IT is learning
            machine learning in order to make education and wellbeing apps/services. I have little IT experience to show. 
            Greatest IT achievements so far would be working out how to solve the "Fizzbuzz" question and jerry-rigging
            ableton plugins together to get sensor data on mobile phones to control visuals and audio for a dance piece 
            (the phones were held by the dancers).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i>
            <p>I chose to come to IT because they would have me. I'm very thankful for RMIT and OUA for this. My academic
            record is long and dismal.</p>
        </li>
        <li><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i>
            <p>I expect to learn how to better manage my time. I'm also hoping to learn general programming concepts I can
            apply to whatever language I'm learning. Lastly (and hopefully) I hope to learn/teach myself how to set up
            neural networks.</p>
