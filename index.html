  <h2>Personal Info</h2>
  <p>B.A. Coelecanth, warmly known as s3490616 is an Australian between the ages of 18 and 180 years old. 
      A dimly interesting fact about B.A. Coelecanth is, as of writing <i>three</i>(that's right, three) months into the only 
      New Year's resolution that's lasted more than a week; the resolution being to "read heaps this year". 14 books finished
      so far (14/03/2019). Good on me.

  <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
  <p>I had some difficulty tracking down an online posting for an ideal job. This is for two reasons-
      It's really, really early days into this career change
      I have a sense of what I want to be doing full-time
      The listing advertises the position of "Senior Interaction Engineer". Day to day of the position
      consists of working with a small team to design, build 
      It's a pretty daunting listing. Having close to 0 of the skills, qualifications, requirements
      So, how am I to get this slew of skills under my belt? From what I can tell, what first appears 
      a big, daunting laundry list of disparate, difficult skills (to learn in 8 years no less) is actually 
      a few clusters of largely interrelated skills
      few nodes
